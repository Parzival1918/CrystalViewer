# CrystalViewer
Viewer of unit cells and miller directions.

Miller Direction is created using a matrix transformation to the start and end points of the arrow. The transformation matrix has to be included with the information of the arrangement (*.csv).

Things to improve now:
  - Add more arrangements with actual numbers.
  - Fix the miller plane drawing function (using the tranformation matrix maybe?).
